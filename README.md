# React Movie Search Website

## Overview
This project is a movie search application built using React.js. It was developed to revise and enhance React.js skills, particularly focusing on concepts such as components, state management, and API integration.

Users can search for movies by title, view basic movie details, and explore more information about their favorite films.

## Features
- Search functionality: Users can search for movies by title.
- API integration: Retrieves movie data from an external API.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.
- Dynamic rendering of search results.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **CSS**: For styling
- **API**: Integration with an external movie database API

## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. **Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/piyushjha5/reactMovieSearchWebsite.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd reactMovieSearchWebsite
3. **Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
4. **Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to use the app.

##How It Works
-Enter a movie title in the search bar.
-The app fetches movie data from the API and dynamically displays the results.
-Click on a movie to view additional details.

##Purpose of the Project
This project was created as part of personal learning and skill development in React.js.. It serves as a practical implementation of core React concepts, including:
-Component-based architecture
-State management with React hooks
-Fetching and handling API responses

##Future Enhancements
-Add advanced search filters (e.g., by genre, release year).
-Improve error handling for API requests.
-Enhance UI/UX for a more intuitive user experience.
-Implement pagination for search results.

##Acknowledgments
-Inspired by various React.js tutorials and documentation.
-Uses movie data provided by The Movie Database API.
